## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Parmis Khosravi
- ðŸ§  Iâ€™m a cognitive neuroscience researcher (postdoc), and educator dedicated to advancing mental health science. My work focuses on translational research, exploring neural circuits that explain the heterogeneities of mood disorders. I take a within-person methodological approach to improve phenotyping and contribute to more precise interventions.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Did you know? A single neural circuit can respond differently depending on social context or emotional stateâ€”thatâ€™s why understanding within-person variability is key to better treatments!

<!-- TO DO: add more details about what I am currently working on and learning, refine the analysis section and add software section, and write a better fun fact section -->
